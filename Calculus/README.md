This folder is where I will keep my notes and program of Calculus as I learned them. I primarily chose to do so due the needed calculus in deep learning.
Note: I learned this from Khan Academy's Calculus I, II, and III course they provide for free(With exercises)
Notes will be posted on my website and programs will be posted here(Ex. Derivatives Calculator, Integral Calculator, Taylor Series Calculator, Multivariate Operations Calculator, etc.)
